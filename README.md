IM MAKIN A PIP BOY AND FOR IT ME OWN INTERFACE!
GOAL- FUNCTIONS
largely for learning stuff

was gonna be based of pip boy 3000 mark iv, now more of my own design because a lot of stuff, mainly i want to design, i want more creative freedom kinda, and i just wanna.

the plan is to be as accurate, mostly to the lore kinda, as possible.
goal is to look and function as much like the ingame pipboy as possible, but more than that to function as much as it should. so like, i'd want a geiger counter and working holotapes, but id probaly leave out a lot of the items stuff, or maybe repurpose it or something.


planed to be on raspberry pi


todo
- fix vlc not being there anymore for some reason
