IM MAKIN A PIP BOY AND FOR IT ME OWN INTERFACE!
TRYNA MAKE IT AS ACCURATE?FUNCTIONAL AS POSSIBLE
mostly for leaning stuff

*based on 3000 mark iv, from fallout 4.* now not true, much of thos is ti be changredc now

the plan is to be as accurate, mostly to the lore kinda, as possible.
goal is to look and function as much like the ingame pipboy as possible, but more than that to function as much as it should. so like, i'd want a geiger counter and working holotapes, but id probaly leave out a lot of the items stuff, or maybe repurpose it or something.


planed to be on raspberry pi


thoughts for stats-



thoughts for items-
- ///grocery list/// no, thatd go in todo list
- in game inventory, like use connectiion to fallout via mod or external software, or for fallout 4 the pip boy app stuff, or like, idk a minecraft mod if it exists, which i feel like it does, to show your inventory on external stuff on like the same internet or localhost type thing
- 



thoughts for data-
- definately have custom inputed "quests", really much work like a todo list. maybe if todoist is on linux


thoughts for map-
- actual map app reskinned
- include mipmap as option


thoughts for radio-


bottom screen buttons in fo4
    a lot of the buttons that would be showing under the pip boy, id have on the bottom accessible via scroll down

text input options
    definately voice input
    keyborad options- either just a keyboard like on a smarttv, one based off a phones number keyboard, or one where you scroll right and left to choose between different letters, and up and down to switch between different sets, like uppercase, lowercase, and special charecters, and at the top, above the default set is to do voice tramscribing, with the active charecter being in the vault tec logo
